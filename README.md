# HOME-Prenatal-PFAS-Cord-Metabolomics

This is the code to accompany my paper, "Associations of a Prenatal Serum Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Mixture with the Cord Serum Metabolome in the HOME Study".

This repository contains the following:
1. An R markdown file with the original code. The code contains an html rendering with tabs for readability when rendered.
2. A pdf file of the rendered Rmarkdown file.
3. An html file of the R markdown file.

This study used data from the HOME Study. This data is not publically available; however, data can be requested here: https://homestudy.research.cchmc.org/contact
