# HOME-Prenatal-PFAS-Cord-Metabolomics

This is the code to accompany my paper: Hall, Amber M., et al. "Associations of a Prenatal Serum Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Mixture with the Cord Serum Metabolome in the HOME Study." Environmental science & technology 57.51 (2023): 21627-21636.

This repository contains the following:
1. An R markdown file with the original code. This file contains the R code the analysis was run in as well as explainations with html code for readability when rendered.
2. A pdf file of the rendered Rmarkdown file with the code and explainations.
3. An html file of the R markdown file.

This study used data from the Health Outcomes and Measured of the Environment (HOME) Study. This data is not publically available; however, data can be requested here: https://homestudy.research.cchmc.org/contact
